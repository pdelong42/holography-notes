Holography Notes
================

Apologies, this is going to be somewhat stream-of-consciousness, until I start organizing it better.

I made a start at this over ten years ago, but got distracted and haven't done much with it since.  I've recently started reading Graham Saxby's book again, which has gotten me back into the mindset.

One excuse was that I was living in an apartment, and had no access to a basement.  Now that I've been a homeowner for over three years now, that's no longer an excuse.

When I last left-off, I was about to try Legos as a subject matter, because they are configurable and controllable.  Playing with my son's Legos last night reminded me of this and gave me renewed motivation.

The smooth surfaces of your typical brick may make specular artifacts a problem though.  I believe that might not be a problem, though, because there are plenty of bricks avaliable with matte surfaces.

Another limitation I ran into was color.  White is the best color for a subject to be, because it reflects all wavelengths more-or-less equally.  Because of this, holographers often paint their subjects white.  This is one advantage of using Legos: one can use exclusively white bricks.

Temperature and vibration stabilization may be issues I have to solve with a disciplined approach.  Basically, I have to shut-off my central air and dehumidifier leading-up to the exposure process.  This may not go over so well with the other members of my household (i.e., wife & son).  I guess I'll see how much time it takes - hopefully no more than 10-15 minutes.  Though in the summer and winter months that may be more challenging.  Spring and autumn are probably the best times to make holograms, because the temperature doesn't fluctuate as much and the central air runs less frequently.

I'm not sure how hard the materials are going to be to procure.  Ten years ago, there was a resurgence in popularity among hobbyists, and as such some companies sprang-up to provide some starter kits.  With the demise of Kodak, and the rise of digital photography, I'm afraid that lots of slide material might have been discontinued.

When I last made some holograms, solid state lasers had become good enough to make exposures with at-least a few inches of depth.  That's what the hobbyist starter kit had in it, anyway.  But I still have my HeNe laser, and I should pull it out of storage to see whether it still works.

This is the first entry (2014-12-21), but I'm envisioning subseqent entries to take the form of a diary.  So I'm going to name entries by date.
