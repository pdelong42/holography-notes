I'm getting a little bit bogged-down with reviewing the theory.  Particularly, I'm reading the appendices of my source materials to get clearer on the low-level differences between transmission and reflection holograms.  The geometry of the interference fringes as they're recorded in the medium is an important difference between the two chief hologram types, and I want to understand this better before proceeding further.  (In one, they are more like venetian blinds - in the transmission holograms, I think; and in the other, they resemble the pages of a book - in the reflection holograms).

Once I figure-out this difference, I'll try to explain it here.  We'll see how little math I can get away with in my explanation.

These are the source materials I've been using:
 - "Practical Holography, 3rd Ed.", by Graham Saxby, IP Publishing Ltd. 2004 (ISBN 0750309121 - paperback)
 - "Optical Holography: Principles, Techniques and Applications", by P. Hariharan, Cambridge University Press 1984 (ISBN 0521311632 - paperback)

Sorry, I don't know what the "P" stands for.  Perhaps I should go find-out, and see what research he's been up to in the past three decades.

Another good resource which I found a while ago, but haven't really seriously delved into yet, is the holography forum: http://holoforum.org/forum/

Maybe I'll add some links to those books online.  There may be more updated versions of them available.  There's also the Holography Handbook.  But the edition of that which I have predates some more recent developments which made the hobby more accessible.

In other news, I've been considering where to develop the media.  I'm not keen on using fixing bleaches in my basement, so I want to see how feasible it is to keep this stuff in my (detached) garage, and do my developing there.  At the very least, it would involve transporting the undeveloped slide or plate in a sealed dark container to the garage.  And doing it in the cold of winter is not a thought I relish.  Never mind the effects the cold might have on the chemistry of the development process.
