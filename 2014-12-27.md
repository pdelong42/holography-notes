I'm getting a little bit bogged-down with reviewing the theory.  Particularly, I'm reading the appendices of my source materials to get clearer on the low-level differences between transmission and reflection holograms.  The geometry of the interference fringes as they're recorded in the medium is an important difference between the two chief hologram types, and I want to understand this better before proceeding further.  (In one, they are more like venetian blinds - in the transmission holograms, I think; and in the other, they resemble the pages of a book - in the reflection holograms).
